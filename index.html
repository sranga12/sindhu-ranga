                                &nbsp; While at a girls only hackathon, my friends and I thought about how as women, we felt <b>quite unsafe walking home at night</b> at our respective colleges. 
                                While colleges do make some effort to keep their students safe at night, we had found that the publically available resources were often very crowded,
                                leading to delays in response time that made these services very unpopular amongst students. There were always paid for options, but as college students,
                                we were all <b>strapped for cash</b>. So what could we do?
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
                                &nbsp; It is from this idea that <b>SafeWalk</b> (also known as Flock) was born. After pitching the idea to one of my professors, I was paid to flesh out this app with 
                                one other peer. This was my first foray into end to end software engineering; I had never worked with many of the technologies I used while building SafeWalk.
                                In the end, my colleague and I built out the whole application and were looking into partnering with our school to bring the app to life. However, due to security
                                issues that we had not forseen, we were unable to partner with our school. This project, however, was not a waste - <b>I still use many of the tools I learned while 
                                coding SafeWalk in my current career.</b>

                                        Doing so opened the information up to other surfaces in the Microsoft suite. This feature identified using machine learning models, which emails were most 
                                        important for users to read depending on their contents and how important the sender was to the user. </p>

                                        Before, the data was not dynamic. Business users needed to ask developers to update data in the card business which led to delays and took up around 20 hours of
                                        developer time per week. Through the use of the tool I built, the code became updatable via the UI, which reduced the work to around 1 developer hour per week.

                            HooHacks is UVA's premier hackathon, and one of the 50 biggest collegiate hackathons in the United States. Around 1000 attendees show up every year, around $70K are managed
                            from many different tech sponsors. This enormous event is managed by a team of around 25 students at UVA. I spent 3 years as a member of HooHacks: 1 as a committee member, 
                            1 as the head of Hacker Experience, and 1 as co-president of the club, and I count it as one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. There were many tasks that needed
                            to be done to make HooHacks possible, so I wore many hats throughout my tenure there; I helped with marketing the event to students, pitching and selling the event to sponsors
                            and handling the logistics of fitting a 1000 people in several small school buildings.

                              Ideathon was an annual engineering & business networking event and pitch competition I originated during my time at UVA. In college, I double majored in Computer Science and
                              Commerce. I had noticed, however, a gap in the intersection of both studies. Even though tech is one of the most entrepreneurial fields, there were not that many opportunities
                              for technically minded students to meet with their business peers at UVA. To bridge that gap, I pitched Ideathon to my fellow members at HooHacks. Originating Ideathon at UVA 
                              meant we needed to build a brand for a brand new event. This was no easy task. Convincing professors, students, and industry professionals to attend an event that no one had
                              ever heard before was one of the hardest things I've had to do. However, I am happy to say that my team and I accomplished it. Ideathon is now in its 4th year at UVA.
